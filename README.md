# gostack9-fase3-reactjs-desafio1
First challenge using React for @Rocketseat GoStack 9.0 bootcamp: a feed similar to Facebook's interface.

**React's first challenge - and challenge 04 - from the Rocketseat GoStack Bootcamp completed!**

The goal was to build a post/comments feed similar to Facebook, but I used creativity to create what would be a comment feed from iDuk, the educational opportunity platform I'm co-founding!

Concepts such as component life cycle, class-based and functional components, props, Babel, and WebPack were used.
